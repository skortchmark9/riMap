KNOWN BUGS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
It's pretty slow - have faith though.

DESIGN DETAILS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
I build the graph as I apply djikstra's in order to be speedy. Didn't do as much good as I'd hoped though.

OPTIMIZATIONS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Mostly little things, specifically getXsByY minimizes the amount of binarysearches. 
The get__Initial() function goes backward to be as fast as possible.
Precompiled regex patterns to make splitting and replacing easy.
TESTING:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Run my system tests with:

ant skortchm_system_test

Run my unit tests with:

ant unit_test

RUNNING:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
compile with ant
then do ./bin/bacon "NAME 1" "NAME 2" <filmsFile> <actorsFile> <indexFile> (for example)
exit with ^C
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you!
