Turn-by-turn directions

- Intersections named the same thing in multiple places do not get direcitons properly... i.e. Charlesfield street & Brown University to wherever...
	- e.g. George Street & Brown University.
		- i.e. there are multiple George Street & Brown University intersections

MapFactory - should behave differently for client vs server.

Make server cleanly disengage
quit gracefully.

When server is not running and client launches, display informative message / wait for server connection

- Create a new type of Response for initial response from server containing:
	a.) traffic data up to that point
	b.) the initial set of ways for the client (and perhaps some extra)

ENSURE THAT THE CLIENT NEVER CRASHES EVEN IF THE SERVER DISAPPEARS


-Think of some nice display for calculated paths other than just highlighting the streets. (e.g. street names, turn-by-turn)
-When you maximize the app, the layout should remain user friendly
-Display fewer roads on zoom out
