MapFactory - should behave differently for client vs server.
Used cached ways in client and save time on network calls

Make server cleanly disengage
quit gracefully.

When server is not running and client launches, display informative message / wait for server connection

- Create a new type of Response for initial response from server containing:
	a.) traffic data up to that point
	b.) the initial set of ways for the client (and perhaps some extra)

ENSURE THAT THE CLIENT NEVER CRASHES EVEN IF THE SERVER DISAPPEARS


-Think of some nice display for calculated paths other than just highlighting the streets. (e.g. street names, turn-by-turn)
-When you maximize the app, the layout should remain user friendly
-Display fewer roads on zoom out
