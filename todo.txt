Need to do:
- RAF copies for each Client Handler * ELIAS (w/ SAM?)
	- make newline hashmap static * ELIAS (w/ SAM?)
- fix buttons in control panel * SAM
- display fewer roads on zoom out // naive * SAM
- turn-by-turn * SAM
- fix tab selection for autofillfields * SAM
- ensure client never crashes even if server disconnects * ELIAS
- Maker 
- display connection status messages (waiting for server, server has disconnected, traffic unavailable, etc.) * ELIAS
- - (tomorrow) - -
- test with 5-10 clients
	- 4 clients running + 2 lcients requesting long path is sufficient
- systems tests on backend 
- jUnit testing 
- commenting, public/private methods, package design 

Cool Features (Not necessary):
 - Periodically check if traffic bot goes up after it has been unavail
 	- same goes for client / server connection
 	- "quit gracefully"
 - save newlines in binary search file
 - displaying fewer roads on zoom out // clever
 - validate autocorrect results
