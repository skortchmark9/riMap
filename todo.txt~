Turn-by-turn directions

MapFactory - should behave differently for client vs server.

Make server cleanly disengage
quit gracefully.

When server is not running and client launches, display informative message / wait for server connection

- Create a new type of Response for initial response from server containing:
	a.) traffic data up to that point
	b.) the initial set of ways for the client (and perhaps some extra)

ENSURE THAT THE CLIENT NEVER CRASHES EVEN IF THE SERVER DISAPPEARS

-Think of some nice display for calculated paths other than just highlighting the streets. (e.g. street names, turn-by-turn)
make the map load less ways if you resize.
-Display fewer roads on zoom out
