Maps Project for CS


I've uploaded my autocorrect to here - it uses a prefix tree instead of a trie, which makes it really fast.

We should probably compare bacons - mine was pretty shitty and I'm not sure why - maybe my binary search was bad. I've been trying to do some profiling and I can't figure it out.


Sam -- I've added some code from my Stars implementation. I didn't include the actual stars program or anything, just what we need for this project. I have a generic KDTree whose nodes can hold any java type which implements KDimensionable (an interface I wrote as part of this package). Take a look if you're interested.
