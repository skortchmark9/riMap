Maps Project for CS


I've uploaded my autocorrect to here - it uses a prefix tree instead of a trie, which makes it really fast.

We should probably compare bacons - mine was pretty shitty and I'm not sure why - maybe my binary search was bad. I've been trying to do some profiling and I can't figure it out.
